## It's Gerard and his comments!

What a great application to build. My daughter is non-verbal, so I'll give you
10 free points up front. Overall it works pretty well, with lots of
functionality. I went into a category and got stuck! Can you get out?

I've left `TODO` comments in the code, and I made some changes in Item.jsx (you
don't have to keep these, they're just an example)

Since we navigate into (and out of?) categories, it's a great use-case for
react-router. I naturally want to use my back button and it doesn't work.

Love that you're using Chakra for accessibility! I love that you've got
speech synthesis!

You've got very good test coverage on your reducers/actions, I'd love to see
a test for your components to assert something like:

> When I click on this item, the sound is played
